# linearshooting
Linear Shooting is a topic i do in university with my friend. It's not super hard but can be complex if u don't know Numerical Analyst
In this, linear shooting can be produced by a lot of Numerical Methods but we only use 3 methods which is we know best. And we also do the truncation error for 3 methods.
